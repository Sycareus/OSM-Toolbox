# OSM-Toolbox

### Update 2021
This was an ugly side project I did while in my first year of college.
It is no longer maintained and will be archived.
You can fork it or take code from it all you want, but be warned that 1) it's messy as fuck and 2) OSM's codebase will probably have changed so much in 5 years it would be easier to start from scratch.
Good luck !
